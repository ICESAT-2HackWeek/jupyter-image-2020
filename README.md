# repo2docker-githubci
a template for building [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) environments with [Repo2Docker](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [GitHub Actions CI](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions)

### How to use

1) click the "Use this template" button to create your own repo

1) create DockerHub account that matches your GitHub username
(could make this configurable)
For example: https://hub.docker.com/u/scottyhq

1) add DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD to repo encrypyted secrets
https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets

1) modify readme links and any files in the `binder/` folder

1) build with GitHub Actions by pushing to GitHub
* commits to master branch trigger re-building image tagged by github short sha and 'latest'
```
git commit -a -m "modified binder/environment to my liking"
git push
```
* pushing a tag results in a docker image with the same tag:
```
git tag -am "tagging 2.3.2" 2.3.2
git push --tags
```

### Pull your image to run a local JupyterLab session
```
export IMAGE=scottyhq/repo2docker-github
export TAG=latest
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/$IMAGE:$TAG
docker run -it --name repo2docker -p 8888:8888 $IMAGE:$TAG jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0
docker stop repo2docker
docker rm repo2docker
```

### Run your image on a BinderHub
Now that you have images on DockerHub, you can re-use them in many ways. For example, create a BinderHub compatible content repository with 'binder' branch that points to a specific image. All your notebooks and scripts can be in the 'master' branch, and are pulled into a BinderHub session with [nbgitpuller](https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller). Structuring things this way means that changes to your scripts won't trigger rebuilding large images:

### Repo history and docker image tags
If you want to check out the build settings for a particular image from https://hub.docker.com/r/scottyhq/repo2docker-githubci/tags, you can return to previous GitHub states with the commit tag. For the tag/short sha `0578e49` we can review the specific commit `https://github.com/scottyhq/repo2docker-githubci/commit/0578e49` or entire repository `https://github.com/scottyhq/repo2docker-githubci/tree/0578e49` at that point in time.

You can also retrive the final list of conda packages installed by looking at the workflow artifact. The first line gets the full commit sha from the short sha:
```bash
LONGSHA=`curl --silent https://api.github.com/repos/scottyhq/repo2docker-githubci/commits/0578e49 | jq ".sha‚Äù`
open https://github.com/scottyhq/repo2docker-githubci/commit/$LONGSHA/checks
```
